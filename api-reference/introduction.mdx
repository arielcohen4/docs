## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens. You'll need to include your API key in the Authorization header of each request:

### Getting Your API Key

1. First, [register for an account](https://app.getflex.ai/sign-in) to get an API key. New accounts come with $5 in credits to get started.

2. Once registered, go to your [API Settings](https://app.getflex.ai/settings/api-keys) to find your API key.

### Using Your API Key

You can use your API key in several ways:

#### Usage

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the header.

```json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```
