# Connecting Your S3 Bucket to FlexAI

This guide will walk you through the process of connecting your AWS S3 bucket to FlexAI. We currently support only AWS S3 for storage integration.

## Step 1: Create an IAM User

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) dashboard.
3. Click on "Users" in the left sidebar, then click "Create user".
4. Enter a username (e.g., "getflex.ai").
5. (Optional) Check "Provide user access to the AWS Management Console" if you want console access.
6. Select "I want to create an IAM user".
7. Click "Next".

## Step 2: Set User Permissions

1. On the permissions page, select "Attach policies directly".
2. Search for and select "AmazonS3FullAccess".
3. Click "Next", then "Create user".
4. Save the sign-in details (URL, username, and password) for this new IAM user.

## Step 3: Create an S3 Bucket

1. Log in to the AWS console using the new IAM user credentials.
2. Navigate to the S3 dashboard.
3. Click "Create bucket".
4. Enter a unique bucket name.
5. Configure bucket settings as needed.
6. Click "Create bucket" at the bottom of the page.

## Step 4: Restrict User Access to the New Bucket

1. Log back into the root AWS account.
2. Go to the IAM dashboard and select "Users".
3. Click on the "getflex.ai" user.
4. Under the "Permissions" tab, click "Add permissions", then "Create inline policy".
5. Switch to the JSON editor and paste the following policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetBucketLocation"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname"]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:GetObject", "s3:DeleteObject"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

6. Replace `your_bucket_name` with the actual name of your bucket.
7. Click "Review policy", give it a name, and click "Create policy".
8. Remove the "AmazonS3FullAccess" policy from the user.

## Step 5: Generate Access Keys

1. In the IAM dashboard, go to the "getflex.ai" user.
2. Navigate to the "Security credentials" tab.
3. Under "Access keys", click "Create access key".
4. Copy the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

## Step 6: Connect to FlexAI

1. Log in to your FlexAI account.
2. Navigate to the Settings > Storage.
3. Enter the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key you just created.
4. Click "Connect".

Congratulations! You've successfully connected your S3 bucket to FlexAI. You can now use this bucket for storing and accessing your data within the FlexAI platform.
